Use DanaSah for ELO list. If you have already tested a version between DanaSah 6.0 and DanaSah 6.4, it is not necessary to test version 6.5 as it has the same search and evaluation, it should have the same ELO. Do not use 6 men scorpio bitbases for games, as it lose some ELO.

DanaSah LimitStrength is a specially version to play with less force, it replaces what I once launched as DanaSahZ. It allows to play by selecting ELO, with levels predefined from newcomer to IM and distinguishes between 3 classes of opponents to adapt his ELO: engine, chesscomputer and human.
